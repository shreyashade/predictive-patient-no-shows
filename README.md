# Medical Appointment No-Show Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict patient no-shows for medical appointments using machine learning. By analyzing historical appointment data, the project identifies patterns and features that indicate a higher probability of a patient missing their appointment. Accurate prediction of no-shows enables healthcare providers to take proactive measures, such as sending reminders, optimizing scheduling, and ultimately improving patient care and resource allocation.

## Motivation

No-shows have significant negative impacts on healthcare systems:

- **Wasted Resources and Financial Losses:** Valuable staff time and resources are lost when patients do not show up for scheduled appointments.
- **Increased Wait Times:** No-shows can disrupt schedules, leading to longer wait times for other patients.
- **Preventable Health Deterioration:** Missed appointments can delay necessary treatments and negatively impact patient health outcomes, particularly for those with chronic conditions.
- **Inefficient Resource Allocation:**  Without accurate prediction, clinics may overbook or underutilize resources.

This project addresses these challenges by developing a predictive model to improve appointment scheduling and resource management.

## Dataset and Features

The project uses a dataset containing historical appointment data, including features such as:

- **Patient Demographics:** Age, gender, neighborhood.
- **Appointment Details:** Appointment day, scheduled day, appointment type.
- **Historical Behavior:** Number of prior appointments, previous no-shows.
- **Other Relevant Information:** Whether the patient received an SMS reminder, scholarship status, and more.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, standardizing column names, and converting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, identifying correlations, and understanding feature relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, such as wait time between scheduling and appointment.
4. **Model Selection and Training:** Comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC AUC, and F1-score.

## Results and Interpretation

The models were evaluated on a held-out test set, and the results showed:

| Model              | Accuracy | ROC AUC | F1 Score |
|----------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.7964   | 0.7549  | 0.3390   |
| Random Forest      | 0.7991   | 0.7644  | 0.3858   |
| XGBoost            | 0.8026   | 0.7715  | 0.3966   |

- **XGBoost achieved the highest performance** across all metrics, indicating its ability to capture complex relationships in the data.
- **While accuracy is high, the relatively lower F1-score** suggests room for improvement in predicting the minority class (no-shows).
- **ROC AUC scores indicate a reasonable ability** of the models to distinguish between patients who will show up and those who won't.

**Interpretation:**

- The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to predict no-shows with reasonable accuracy.
- The results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and engineering features to improve predictive performance.
- Future work could explore more advanced modeling techniques, such as deep learning, and address class imbalance to further enhance the model's ability to identify potential no-shows.

## Usage

The trained model can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient missing a future appointment. By providing the relevant features for a new patient, the model generates a prediction, allowing healthcare providers to make informed decisions.
